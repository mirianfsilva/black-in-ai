### Highlight
*In addition to providing scholarships to cover costs associated with navigating academic programs, Black in AI awards need-based travel grants to attend our annual events including our workshop at the NeruIPS conference, and additional events in other conferences such as [AAAI](https://www.aaai.org/), [CVPR](http://cvpr2021.thecvf.com/), [ACL](https://acl2020.org/), [ICML](https://icml.cc/), [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/), [COLING](https://coling2020.org/) and [FAccT](https://facctconference.org/2021/). Our grants cover flights, accommodation, daily per diems, visa fees, data grants, and registration for the conferences. Since the first Black in AI workshop in 2017, **400+** works from **40+** countries have been presented with over **$1M** given out in travel grants supporting **400+** people. Many members cannot afford to first pay out of pocket and then receive reimbursements. Thus we also make travel arrangements for them including booking airfare and accommodation.*

Through these efforts our members have received scholarships to conferences to present their work, received funding to attend summer schools, various types of fellowships, and support to attend other events that have been transformational.
