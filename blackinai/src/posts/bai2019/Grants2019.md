## Travel Grants
----
Need-based travel grants will be awarded to workshop participants. Participants do not need to submit a paper in order to be considered for a travel grant. The travel grant can be used for covering costs associated with the workshop such as NIPS registration, accommodation and travel. Please note that the travel grants may not cover all of your costs and we may not be able to award them to all applicants. The amount of money we award to each person will depend on the number of applicants and the location each applicant will be traveling from.

Travel grants are available for eligible attendees, and must be submitted by __Wed July 31, 2019 11:00 PM UTC__ __Now extended to:__ __Wed Aug 07, 2019 11:00 PM UTC:__ at the latest (Note that this is one day after the paper submission deadline).

Notifications about Travel Grants will be sent out from 30th August, 2019! Please check your email from this date.
