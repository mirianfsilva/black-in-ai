### Highlights
*Black in AI’s advocacy has focused on removing barriers faced by Black people around the world in the field of AI. Our advocacy has helped remove the GRE as an admissions requirement by some graduate schools in the US, helped shed light on visa issues that Africans and members of the African diaspora face while attempting to attend major international AI conferences, the lack of presence by international companies on the African continent, and the choice of conference locations that exclude many members of our community.*s

Our advocacy on barriers faced by our members has resulted in new processes by conferences such as NeurIPS to mitigate the barriers they face, an increase in the number of Black keynote speakers at major AI related events, and the first Google AI center in Africa (Accra, Ghana). Some additional highlights include:

- Graduate schools such as Cornell and UC Berkeley’s computer science departments have accepted a record number of Black students into their programs.
- As a result of publicity regarding BAI’s visa issues (which Justin Trudeau was asked about by reporters), Canada’s minister of innovation has agreed to work with NeurIPS to ease visa related issues in the future.
- Our efforts would have brought ICLR to Ethiopia, which would have made it the first major international AI conference to be held in Africa. It was unfortunately held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic but still featured 2 Black women as keynote speakers for the first time, and workshops like Africa NLP and Practical ML for the developing world. 
- Since Black in AI’s first workshop in December 2017, many new AI focused-affinity groups such as LatinX in AI, Queer in AI, {Dis} Ability in AI, and Indigenous AI have been formed. Just as there was and is a need for Black in AI, there is a need for representation across all disciplines. Many Black in X groups have been formed across disciplines including Black in Neuro, Black in Robotics, Black in Quantum, Black Women in AI, Black in Data, Black Women in Data, to name a few.
- The annual Black in AI workshop has pioneered remote meetups and telepresence to increase diversity and inclusion.
